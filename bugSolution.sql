The issue can be solved in several ways, depending on the desired outcome.

**Solution 1: Modify the subquery to return a single row.**
This involves using aggregate functions like `MAX()`, `MIN()`, or `AVG()` within the subquery if you only need one specific value. If the intent is to check for the existence of any rows matching certain conditions, using `EXISTS` is suitable.

```sql
--Original buggy query
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'London');

--Solution using EXISTS
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments WHERE location = 'London' AND department_id = employees.department_id);

-- Solution using IN if multiple departments are expected
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'London');
```

**Solution 2: Use `IN` or `ANY` in the outer query**
If you need to handle multiple rows returned by the subquery, use the `IN` operator in the outer query to compare against multiple values. Alternatively, use `ANY` or `ALL`.

```sql
--Example using IN
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'London');
```
The best solution depends on the specific requirements of the query and the relationship between the tables. Choose the solution that appropriately addresses the situation and returns the expected results.
