This repository contains examples of a common SQL error: when a subquery returns more than one row, and the outer query is expecting a single value.  The `bug.sql` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.sql` provides solutions. The error commonly occurs when using functions like `IN`, `=` or `EXISTS` that expects single-value comparisons but receives a multiple-row result. Solutions might involve adjusting the subquery to return only one row using aggregate functions or joins or changing the outer query's logic to handle multiple rows appropriately using `IN` or `ANY`.
